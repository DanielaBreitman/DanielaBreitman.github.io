I am (and have been for over three years) a member of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) project. Last year, I completed my undergrad in Honours Mathematics and Physics at McGill University. In my spare time, I engage in art, such as painting, drawing, and digital art.</p>
