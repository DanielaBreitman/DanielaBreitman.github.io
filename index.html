              <p class="lead"> I am a PhD student at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. I work on applying machine learning methods to various problems in cosmology with [Andrei Mesinger]{http://homepage.sns.it/mesinger/Main.html}. You can see all of my publications so far [here]{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22breitman%2C%20daniela%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0}. In 2021, I finished my Master's at the University of Toronto, where I worked on modelling astrophysical signals from objects known as fast radio bursts (FRBs) with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). In 2020, I graduated from McGill University in Honours Mathematics and Physics.</p>
