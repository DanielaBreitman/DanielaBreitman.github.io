              <p class="lead"> I am a PhD student at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. 
                I work on applying machine learning methods to various problems in cosmology 
                with <a href="http://homepage.sns.it/mesinger/Main.html">Andrei Mesinger</a>. 
                You can see all of my publications so far 
                <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22breitman%2C%20daniela%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">here</a> 
                and my CV <a href="https://github.com/DanielaBreitman/DanielaBreitman.github.io/blob/master/Files/CV.pdf">here</a>. 
                <br> TL;DR:
                <ul> 
                    <li> <b>2021-:</b> PhD at SNS in Pisa in machine learning and cosmology.</li>
                    <li> <b>2020-2021:</b> Master's at the University of Toronto 
                        on modelling from extragalactic objects 
                        known as fast radio bursts (FRBs) with the 
                        Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME).</li>
                    <li><b>2017-2020:</b> BSc at McGill University in Honours Mathematics and Physics.</li>
                     </ul> </p>
                I plan to transition toward more ML-oriented projects in the future! 
                If you are in the field of machine learning and seek collaborators for some project, feel free to contact me.
                I am always looking for spicy projects to which to contribute.
